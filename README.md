# Appointment-Planner
Codecademy React Challenge 

## Project Goals
In this project, I use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. 
The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.
I work with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks.
